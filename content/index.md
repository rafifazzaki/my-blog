Hey, welcome to my blog!  
this is the first note that you see when navigating this blog/garden..  
  
You can see some newest pages/notes that i publish here:  
  
>[!cite]  Newest notes  
>``` dataview  
TABLE file.ctime AS date SORT file.mtime asc LIMIT 3  
>```  
  
  
Or you can see some topic that you may interested on the left (desktop) or if you are on mobile you can see some topic here!  
  
>[!tip] Navigating this garden (Sections)  
> ``` dataview  
>TABLE description AS "Description" FROM #sections   
>```  
  
  
You can also see what notes connected with this note on the *Graph View* and which note referenced this note on *Backlinks*.  
  
I think that's all  
Thank you, and happy reading!
